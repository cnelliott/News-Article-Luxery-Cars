			New 2017 BMW 760i Similar to this year’s field of presidential prospects, the top echelon of luxury cars offers a variety of facility selections experienced by a couple of outsiders.

Alpina’s hand is felt more highly inside the B7, where a special Alpina steering wheel features green and also blue sewing and even the brand’s supremely unfulfilling manual-shift switches rather than paddles.
